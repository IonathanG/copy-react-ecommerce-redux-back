## React Shopping App with Redux Toolkit and Firebase

This react project is part of a series of individual apps built to showcase some of my personal Front End Development Skills.

The website is designed as a scalable full stack application E-Commerce Page (clothing items).

It uses a fully responsive UI Design, allowing each user to create an account and to save items onto their shopping cart in Firestore via their personal profile.

Other projects can be found within the following Portolio website as well as on this GitHub Repositories.

## Code Feature

Load Firestore into Redux Toolkit with AsyncThunk and extraReducers (user not logged in):

```javascript
export const getUserData = createAsyncThunk(
  "data/getUserData",
  async (userID) => {
    const docRef = doc(db, "users", `${userID}`);
    const docSnap = await getDoc(docRef);

    if (docSnap.exists()) {
      console.log("Document data:", docSnap.data());
      const storedData = window.localStorage.state
        ? JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("state"))
        : undefined;

      localStorage.removeItem("state");
      return { dataDB: docSnap.data(), storedData };
    } else {
      console.log("No such document");
    }
  }
);
```

```javascript
extraReducers: {
 [getGuestData.pending]: (state) => {
      state.initUser = false;
    },
    [getGuestData.fulfilled]: (state, { payload }) => {
      if (payload) {
        state.listItems = payload.listItems;
        state.totalQuantity = payload.totalQuantity;
        state.wishList = payload.wishList;
      }
      state.initUser = true;
    },
    [getGuestData.rejected]: (state) => {
      state.initUser = false;
    },
  }
```
